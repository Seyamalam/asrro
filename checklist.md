# ASRRO Web Portal — SRS Checklist

Source: [`docs/SRS.docx`](docs/SRS.docx), version 1.0.

This checklist converts the complete SRS into independently verifiable acceptance items. Status was audited against the repository on 3 August 2026.

**Current snapshot:** 314 of 418 items checked; 104 items remain incomplete, partial, externally dependent, or unverified.

- `[x]` — implemented with a usable repository code path.
- `[ ]` — missing, only partially wired, externally dependent, or not supported by reproducible acceptance evidence yet.

The status is intentionally conservative: a schema field, placeholder, or responsive CSS rule alone does not count as a completed user workflow.
